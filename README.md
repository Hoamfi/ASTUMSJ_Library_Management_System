# ðŸ“š ASTUMSJ Library Management System

## Overview
The **ASTUMSJ Library Management System** is a full-stack MERN application built to support the ASTU Muslim Jemea Library.  
It was developed as the **final project** for the **ASTUMSJ Fullstack Summer Camp** (3 months).  

The app provides a complete solution for:
- Managing books and borrowing
- Tracking donations
- Handling student accounts
- Secure authentication & OTP verification
- Admin dashboards and analytics

ðŸ‘‰ This project shows both **technical ability** and **team collaboration skills**. It was developed by Ammar Sabit and Hosam Adem, with the repository hosted under Hoamfi. Our collaboration exemplifies strong team dynamics: we divided tasks strategically (e.g., Ammar focusing on frontend components and UI/UX, Hosam on backend logic and database modeling), conducted regular code reviews, resolved conflicts through pair programming, and iterated based on milestone feedback.
